            <h2>What is a book?</h2>
            <p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.</p>
            <h2>Wisdom</h2>
            <q class="index-column-quote">If you don’t like to read, you haven’t found the right book.</q>

            <br/>
            <q class="index-column-quote">One glance at a book and you hear the voice of another person, perhaps someone dead for 1,000 years. To read is to voyage through time.</q>

            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>The history of the book starts with the development of writing, and various other inventions such as paper and printing, and continues through to the modern day business of book printing. The earliest history of books actually predates what
                would conventionally be called "books" today and begins with tablets, scrolls, and sheets of papyrus. Then hand-bound, expensive, and elaborate manuscripts known as codices appeared. These gave way to press-printed volumes and eventually
                lead to the mass printed tomes prevalent today. Contemporary books may even have no physical presence with the advent of the e-book. The book also became more accessible to the disabled with the advent of Braille and spoken books.</p>
